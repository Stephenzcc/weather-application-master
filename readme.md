# Weather application

I used the free json file from https://mpianatra.com/Courses/forecast.json to predict the weather.
Click the button, you will get the weather of 5 days from today.
In the left side, you will get weather, location, and date.
In the right side, you will get the temperature.
In the bottom, you will get 4 days' weather of future.
